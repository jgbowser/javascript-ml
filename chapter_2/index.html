        This is the evaluated value of the model after training using random
        weights
      </p>
      <p id="random-output"></p>
      <p>This is the average time it took all training data to download</p>
      <p id="avg-delay"></p>
      <p>
        This is the hand calculated mean absolute error of the test data based
        on the above constant, we can see that our model performs pretty poorly
        by comparing the two output values
      </p>
      <p id="mae"></p>
      <p>
        Now we try adding more epochs (steps) to the training to give the model
        a better chance to hone in on a better error rate
      </p>
      <p id="more-epochs"></p>
      <p>And now we can make some predictions</p>

  // my results are looking a bit different here, but in the book they are doing all of this at this codepen (https://codepen.io/tfjs-book/pen/VEVMMd),
  // so maybe I am missing some things that they are doing there that they aren't making as explicit in the little examples they give in the book
